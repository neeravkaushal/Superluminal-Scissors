Analyses of Scissors Cutting Paper at Superluminal Speeds

A popular physics legend holds that scissors can cut paper with a speed faster than light. Here this counter-intuitive myth is investigated theoretically using four simple examples of scissors. For simplicity, all cases will involve a static lower scissors blade that remains horizontal just under the paper. In the first case, the upper blade will be considered perfectly rigid as it rotates around and through the paper, while in the second case, a rigid upper blade will drop down to cut the paper like a guillotine. In the third case, the paper is cut with a laser rotating with a constant angular speed that is pointed initially perpendicular to the paper at the closest point, while in the fourth case, the uniformly rotating laser is pointed initially parallel to the paper. Although details can be surprising and occasionally complex, all cases allow sections of the paper to be cut faster than light without violating special relativity. Therefore, the popular legend is confirmed, in theory, to be true.
